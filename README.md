## 👋 Hi, I’m Kweku

I’m a Senior Android Engineer with 6+ years of experience building consumer-facing Android apps and platform SDKs used at scale. I specialize in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, with a strong focus on clean architecture, developer experience, and long-term maintainability.

### What I’m working on
- Building and maintaining FanCompanion Android apps such as Love Island UK and This Morning
- Owning a Kotlin-based Interaction SDK embedded across 20+ apps and teams
- Designing modular systems that support real-time features like live polls, quizzes, and video playback
- Shipping reliable Android apps with a 99.8% crash-free rate to 300k+ users per season

### What I care about
- Writing code that’s easy to reason about, test, and evolve
- Improving developer experience through good abstractions and tooling
- Balancing speed and quality in fast-moving product teams
- Building mobile software that works well in real-world conditions

### My background
Before my current role, I worked as a freelance software engineer delivering mobile and backend solutions for clients across agriculture, ecommerce, and media. I’ve also built field data collection tools used in rural environments, including an app that helped map 3,500+ trees as part of an environmental initiative in Ghana.

### Tech I work with
- **Android**: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android SDK
- **Architecture**: Modular apps & SDKs, clean architecture
- **Backend & Infra**: REST, GraphQL, Firebase, AWS
- **Delivery**: GitLab CI/CD, Bitrise, Google Play Console

I enjoy collaborating with product, design, and backend teams, reviewing PRs, and making architectural decisions that help teams move faster without sacrificing quality.
